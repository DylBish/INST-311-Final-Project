''' The statistical winner is assigned the numbers 1 through the statistical value output within the terminal.
    
    Example: The statistical faceoff winner is the Carolina Panthers with 7 out of 11 points.
             Thus, the the Carolina Panthers are assigned the numbers 1 through 7 for their probability.
             Thus, the opposing team, whichever that may be, will be assigned the ladder numbers up to 11. 
             In this example, they would be give numbers 8 through 11

    The randomizer output allows there to be 'real world' probability invovled within the faceoff making it
    possible for the so called underdog to win.
    
    Example(Continued): In refernece to the example noted above, if the randomizer outputs any number between 
                        1 and 7 , the Carolina Panthers will recieve the win. If the randomizer outputs any 
                        number between 8 and 11, the opposing team wins.
